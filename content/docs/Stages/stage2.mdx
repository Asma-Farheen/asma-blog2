# ⚙️ Part 2 — React Hooks with Practical Examples

React Hooks are built-in functions that let you use React features such as **state**, **lifecycle events**, and **context** without writing class components.  
They make React simpler, more functional, and reusable.

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

// Update the value
setCount(count + 1);
