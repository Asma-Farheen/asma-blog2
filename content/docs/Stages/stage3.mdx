## 🔹 What is a Component?

A **Component** is like a **reusable block of UI**.  
You can think of it as a **small piece of your webpage** that can be created, used, and reused anywhere.

In React, we mainly use **Functional Components**.

**Example:**
```js
function Welcome() {
  return <h2>Hello, Welcome to my React App!</h2>;
}

export default Welcome;
